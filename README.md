# Go-Turing-Machine

A Turing Machine implementation in Go as well as a declarative programming language for the Turing Machine.
The language supports macros, which are lightweight functions that take no arguments.

## UPDATE
I'm reviving this project! Expect lots of improvements, clean-ups, refactoring, and new stuff!
See the issues tab for my current TODO-list.
