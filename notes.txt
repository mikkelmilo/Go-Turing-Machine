(p_1, σ)M(p_2,p_3)
if M ends in h_a go to p_2
else if M ends in h_r go to p_3

Semantic rules:

Whenever a macro application (p_1, σ)M(p_2,p_3) is used, the sequence of statements within
the definition of the macro is simply substituted in place of the macro application.
The 'ha' and 'hr' inside the macro definition are replaced with transitions
to p_2 and p_3, respectively. Thus, if the macro ends in state 'ha', then
in the macro application it will instsead end din p_2, and likewise for 'hr' and p_2.


TML programs must contain a (reachable) start state, an accept state, and a reject state.
Inside a macro definition there must exist a (reachable) accept & reject state.
